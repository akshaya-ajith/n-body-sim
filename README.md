# n-body-sim

Solar system simulator using Verlet velocities.

A direct N-Body Simulator. Utilizes elementary molecular dynamics to simulate a solar system using Newtonian mechanics and the Newtonian law of universal gravitation. Very, very simple.

My introduction to computational physics modeling, and numerical methods to solve differential equations.
